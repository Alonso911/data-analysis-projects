# Data Analysis Projects:
This repository contains projects that were made to get hands-on experience in applying data analysis best practices.
Each project has its unique purpose, but they all share the same approach of problem-solving, business-oriented thinking that is needed for completing the task at hand.
The coding was done in Jupyter Notebook with Python.
