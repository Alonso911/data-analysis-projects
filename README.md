# Data Analysis Projecs:
This repository contains projects that were made to get hands-on experience in applying data analysis best practices.
Each project has its unique purpose, but they all share the same approach of problem-solving, business-oriented thinking that is needed for completing the task at hand.
The coding was done in Jupyter Notebook with Python.

## Online Store User Behavior Analysis:
This project features an event-based type of analysis. We investigated user behavior for the company's app, analyzed the results of an A/B test
that examined if a change in the app font would increase user conversion rate.

The project include the following stages:
1. Data preprocessing.
2. Study of the general information of the data.
3. Study of the event funnel.
4. Analyzing the results of the A/B test and testing hypotheses.

### Main python libraries used:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

### Files description:
- user behavior analysis.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook file.
- user behavior analysis.py - Python code.
- logs_exp_us.csv - Dataset used in the project.

## Video Game Store Sales Analysis:
This project features an analysis of the video games industry. We read data from 1980 to 2016 about video games releases from an online video games store. 
User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources.
Identified patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow us to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.

The project include the following stages:
1. Data preprocessing.
2. Exploratory data analysis.
3. Creating a user profile to each region.
4. Testing hypotheses.
