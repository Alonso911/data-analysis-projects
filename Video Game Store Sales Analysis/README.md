# Video Game Store Sales Analysis:
This project features an analysis of the video games industry. We read data from 1980 to 2016 about video games releases from an online video games store. 
User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources.
Identified patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow us to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.

The project include the following stages:
1. Data preprocessing.
2. Exploratory data analysis.
3. Creating a user profile to each region.
4. Testing hypotheses.
